# Capstone Project for BINF8960 Genomics for Beginners

### Genomics Pipeline
- Project setup (setup.sh)
- Run Quality Control (QC_Trim.sh)
- Trim Adapters off the sequences (QC_Trim.sh)
- Align reads to the reference genome (variant_calling.sh)
- Call variants in the aligned reads (variant_calling.sh)
- Get the read counts and number of variants (summary_stats.sh)
- Script to run full pipeline (batch.sh)

### Files
- data - quality control output files for raw and trimmed reads
- results - csv file with the summary_statistics

### Analysis
- Capstone_Project.pdf - Project Report with write-up and analyses
- Capstone_Project.Rmd - R mark down file of Project Report
